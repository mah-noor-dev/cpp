⚙️ C++ Programs – From Basics to Data Structures
📌 Overview
This repository is a well-organized collection of C++ programs, ranging from fundamental concepts to intermediate and advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is designed to support learners at every stage — whether you're just starting with C++ or tackling complex DSA problems for technical interviews and academic success.

Each program is carefully written with clarity and good programming practices, offering modular, easy-to-understand code with comments and logical structure. The repository is ideal for students, self-learners, and aspiring software engineers aiming to strengthen their programming foundation.

🧠 What’s Included
The repository covers a progressive set of topics:

🔹 Basic Syntax & I/O – Variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions

🔹 Arrays & Strings – Traversal, pattern problems, sorting, searching

🔹 Pointers & Dynamic Memory – Pointer logic, memory allocation

🔹 Structures & OOP – Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism

🔹 Recursion – Classic problems like factorial, Fibonacci, subsets

🔹 Stacks & Queues – Implementation via arrays, linked lists, and STL

🔹 Linked Lists – Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists

🔹 Trees – Binary trees, traversal methods, basic operations

🔹 Sorting & Searching Algorithms – Bubble sort, insertion sort, binary search, etc.

Each section reflects a clear learning curve — starting from logic building to more structured problem solving using well-known algorithms and data structures.

🛠 Technologies Used
Language: C++ (Standard C++11 and above)

Tools/Editors: Any C++ compatible IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, or Dev C++

Standard Template Library (STL): Used in some programs for optimized code

📈 Learning Outcomes
By exploring this repository, learners will:

Develop a strong foundation in C++ syntax and logic

Understand real-world use of data structures and their implementations

Practice algorithmic thinking and clean coding habits

Prepare effectively for coding interviews, university exams, or competitive programming

🌱 Future Enhancements
Organize programs into topic-wise folders (e.g., arrays, recursion, linked lists)

Add documentation and markdown explanations for complex topics

Include advanced problems: graphs, backtracking, dynamic programming

Add sample outputs or test cases for selected programs

This collection is more than just code — it’s a path for mastering C++ from the ground up. Whether you're revising concepts or learning from scratch, this repository is a reliable companion for your programming journey.
